## 🧱 Fundamental Elements

### 🔹 Scalar
A **scalar** is a single numeric value. It can represent quantities like mass, temperature, or scale factors.

### 🔹 Vector
A **vector** is a one-dimensional array of values. Each value represents a component in a specific direction.
- **Row vector**: Horizontal orientation
- **Column vector**: Vertical orientation
- Used to represent force, velocity, position, etc.

### 🔹 Matrix
A **matrix** is a 2D array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
- Represents transformations, datasets, and systems of equations
- Can be square (equal rows and columns) or rectangular

### 🔹 Tensor
A **tensor** is a multi-dimensional generalization of scalars (0D), vectors (1D), and matrices (2D).
- Used in physics and deep learning to model multi-dimensional data

## 🧮 Key Operations in Linear Algebra

### ✅ Matrix Addition & Subtraction
- Combine matrices of the same dimensions by adding/subtracting corresponding elements.

### ✅ Scalar Multiplication
- Multiply each element of a matrix or vector by a single scalar value.

### ✅ Matrix Multiplication
- Combines two matrices where the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second.
- Used in graphics, transformations, and neural networks.

### ✅ Transposition
- Flip a matrix across its diagonal (rows become columns).

### ✅ Determinant
- A scalar value that represents properties of a matrix like invertibility.
- Used to find matrix inverses and solve linear systems.

### ✅ Inverse Matrix
- A matrix that "undoes" a transformation.
- Exists only if the matrix is square and non-singular.

### ✅ Rank of Matrix
- Number of linearly independent rows or columns.
- Determines the solvability of systems of equations.

## 🔄 Solving Systems of Linear Equations

A **system of equations** involves finding values for variables that satisfy multiple equations simultaneously.

### 🔧 Common Methods:
- **Substitution**: Solve one equation and plug into another.
- **Elimination**: Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable.
- **Matrix Method**: Represent the system using matrices and apply transformations.
- **Gaussian Elimination**: Systematic method using row operations.
- **Inverse Method**: If a coefficient matrix is invertible, multiply both sides by the inverse.

A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be formed as a linear combination of others.

### 🔸 Basis
A minimum set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire vector space.

### 🔸 Dimension
The number of vectors in the basis of a space.

### 🔸 Span
All possible linear combinations of a set of vectors.

### 🔸 Null Space (Kernel)
The set of all vectors that result in a zero vector when multiplied by a matrix.

### 🔸 Column Space (Range)
The set of all possible outputs (vectors) when a matrix acts on input vectors.

### 🔸 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Eigenvector: A vector whose direction remains unchanged after transformation.
- Eigenvalue: The scalar by which the eigenvector is scaled.
- Widely used in quantum physics, stability analysis, PCA, etc.
