## Core Structure

This guide is built around the foundational elements of Linear Algebra:

- **Scalars**: Single numerical values.
- **Vectors**: One-dimensional arrays representing magnitude and direction.
- **Matrices**: Two-dimensional arrays representing transformations or systems of equations.
- **Tensors**: Multi-dimensional generalizations of scalars, vectors, and matrices.
