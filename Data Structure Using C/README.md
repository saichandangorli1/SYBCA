# Data Structures Using C

This folder provides course materials and code examples for Data Structures, implemented in the C programming language.

-----

## Key Topics Covered 

The code examples in this folder cover the following core areas:

  * **Fundamentals**: Algorithm complexity, arrays, and basic searching and sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion).
  * **Linear Data Structures**: Implementations of Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular), Stacks, and Queues.
  * **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Implementations of Trees (Binary Search Trees) and Graphs, including common traversal methods (BFS, DFS).
  * **Core Operations**: In-depth examples of traversal, insertion, and deletion for each data structure.

-----

## Prerequisites 

  * A solid understanding of the **C programming language**.
