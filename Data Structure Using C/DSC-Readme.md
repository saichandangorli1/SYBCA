# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures Using C

This repository contains materials and code examples for the Data Structures Using C module. It covers the implementation, advantages, and key concepts of various data structures using the C programming language.

## Core Structure

This course covers the foundational elements of data structures, categorized as:

* **Linear Data Structures:** Structures where data elements are arranged sequentially.
    * Array
    * Linked List
    * Stack
    * Queue
* **Non-Linear Data Structures:** Structures where data elements are not in a sequence.
    * Tree
    * Graph

## Units

1.  **Introduction to C & Data Structures:** Understanding why C is suitable for data structures, memory management (`malloc`, `free`), and the role of pointers.
2.  **Linear Data Structures:** In-depth implementation and use cases for Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
3.  **Non-Linear Data Structures:** Exploring the implementation of hierarchical (Trees) and network (Graphs) structures.
4.  **Core Operations & Algorithms:** Covering essential concepts like traversing, searching, sorting, and the role of loops.

## Key Points

### Linear Data Structures

* Array
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue

### Non-Linear Data Structures

* Tree
* Graph

### Essential Concepts

* Traversing
* Memory Management

## What is the User Providing?

This repository provides source code (`.c` files) and explanatory notes for various data structures. It's designed for learners who want to understand the underlying mechanics of each structure by implementing them in C.

## Requisites

* A solid understanding of the **C programming language**, including pointers, structs, and memory allocation.
* A C compiler installed on your system (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) on Linux/Windows or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) on macOS).
* A text editor or IDE (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)).

## How to Use Folder

1.  Navigate to a specific C file in your terminal.
2.  Compile the C source file using your compiler. For example, with GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc your_file_name.c -o output_program
    ```
    (Replace `your_file_name.c` with the name of the C file and `output_program` with your desired executable name).
3.  Run the compiled program from your terminal:
    ```bash
    ./output_program
