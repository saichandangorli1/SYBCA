# 📘 Data Structures Using C

This document offers a detailed explanation of Data Structures implemented using the **C programming language**, covering their types, uses, advantages, and key concepts like traversing, memory management, and loops.

## 🧠 What are Data Structures?

A **Data Structure** is a specialized format to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. They are essential in computer science and software engineering for writing optimized programs that scale.

### 🔑 Why Use Data Structures?
- Efficient data processing
- Reduced time and space complexity
- Faster searching, sorting, and accessing
- Better management of large data

---

## 🔧 Why C for Data Structures?

C is a powerful procedural language that provides low-level memory access through **pointers**, making it ideal for implementing various data structures manually without built-in abstraction layers.

### ✅ Benefits of C for DS:
- Manual memory control (malloc, free)
- Pointer arithmetic for dynamic structures
- Structured programming paradigm
- Fast execution time
- Rich standard library for basic I/O and memory ops

## 🧱 Types of Data Structures

### 1. 🔹 Primitive Data Structures
These are built-in data types provided by C:
- **int**
- **char**
- **float**
- **double**
- **void**

### 2. 🔸 Non-Primitive Data Structures
These are user-defined and allow storing large and complex data.

#### ➤ **Linear Data Structures**
- **Array**: Stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory.
- **Linked List**: Each element (node) points to the next.
- **Stack**: Follows LIFO, insertion/deletion at one end (top).
- **Queue**: Follows FIFO, insertion at rear and deletion from front.

#### ➤ **Non-Linear Data Structures**
- **Tree**: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships.
- **Graph**: Set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

## 📊 Detailed Overview of Common Structures

### 🔷 Array
- Static memory allocation
- Elements accessed using indices
- Size must be declared before use

**Use Cases:** Matrix operations, lookup tables, string manipulation

**Limitations:** Inflexible size, inefficient insertion/deletion

---

### 🔷 Linked List
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Nodes contain data + pointer to next
- No fixed size, grows/shrinks at runtime

**Types:** Singly, Doubly, Circular

**Use Cases:** Dynamic memory management, stacks/queues, file systems

---

### 🔷 Stack
- Works on **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)**
- Push (insert) and Pop (delete) from top
- Can be implemented using array or linked list

**Use Cases:** Undo operations, recursion calls, syntax parsing

---

### 🔷 Queue
- Works on **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**
- Enqueue (insert) at rear, Dequeue (remove) from front

**Types:** Circular, Priority, Double-ended

**Use Cases:** CPU scheduling, printers, data buffers

---

### 🔷 Tree
- Hierarchical structure with root node
- Each node has 0 or more children

**Types:** Binary Tree, BST, AVL, Heap

**Use Cases:** File system hierarchy, databases, routers

---

### 🔷 Graph
- Set of vertices and edges
- Can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted

**Representation:** Adjacency matrix or list

**Use Cases:** Social networks, road maps, dependency graphs

---

## 🔁 Traversing in C

**Traversing** refers to visiting each element in a structure to perform operations like read, update, or display.

### 💡 Methods:
- **Array**: Use loops (for/while)
- **Linked List**: Use loops and pointers
- **Tree/Graph**: Use recursive traversal (DFS, BFS)

---

## 🌀 Role of Loops in DS Using C

Loops are essential in traversing and managing data:
- Used for sequential access and iteration
- Reduces code complexity
- Handles repetitive operations on elements

**Types:** `for`, `while`, `do-while`

They provide better performance and readability compared to manual or recursive approaches for simpler structures like arrays.

## 📋 Advantages of Data Structures

| Feature             | Benefits                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Efficient Access     | Fast searching and retrieval of data       |
| Memory Management    | Optimize usage and allocation of memory    |
| Real-time Processing | Enables queues, buffers, scheduling        |
| Data Abstraction     | Encapsulates data and operations           |

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages (When Misused)

- **Wrong DS** leads to performance issues
- **Arrays** waste memory if over-allocated
- **Linked Lists** use extra memory for pointers
- **Complex structures** (like graphs) may require advanced logic
