## Units

1. **Advanced HTML Features**: Exploring semantic elements, forms, multimedia, and graphics.  
2. **Local Server Environment**: Setting up and managing a local web server using XAMPP and Apache.  
3. **Server-Side Scripting**: An introduction to PHP for creating dynamic web pages.

## Key Points

### XAMPP & Apache

- **XAMPP**: A free and open-source, cross-platform web server solution stack. It stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P). You can download it from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

- **Apache**: The web server software that processes requests from browsers and serves web pages. It’s the ‘A’ in XAMPP.

    - **htdocs Directory**: This is the root directory for your web projects. Any file you want to see on your local web server must be placed inside `xampp/htdocs/`.

    - **XAMPP Control Panel**: A simple interface to start and stop services like Apache and MySQL.

### PHP - More about PHP

- **Server-Side Language**: PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the browser as plain HTML.

- **Handling Form Data**: Using the `$_GET` and `$_POST` superglobal arrays to collect data submitted from HTML forms.

## How to Use Folder

1. Ensure you have **XAMPP installed** and running on your system.  
2. Place this entire project folder inside the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. (e.g. `C:/xampp/htdocs/`)  
3. Start the Apache module from the XAMPP Control Panel.  
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-folder-name/` to view the projects. (Replace `your-folder-name` with the actual name of this folder.)
